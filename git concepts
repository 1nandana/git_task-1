Concepts of Git
Repository (Repo):
A Git repository serves as a centralized storage unit for files and their entire history. It enables easy collaboration and tracking of modifications made to files over time.

Commit:
A commit in Git represents a snapshot of changes made to files at a specific moment. Each commit is uniquely identified by a hash and includes information detailing the modifications made.

Branch:
A branch in Git is a divergent version of a repository, allowing changes to occur independently without affecting the primary codebase. Branches are commonly used for feature development or bug fixes.

Merge:
Merging in Git is the process of combining changes from different branches. It involves integrating the modifications made in one branch into another.

Pull Request (PR):
A pull request in Git is a proposal for changes to a repository. It facilitates collaborative review and discussion among team members before the proposed changes are merged into the main codebase.

Basic Git Commands
git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git add <file>: Adds changes in a file to the staging area.
git commit -m "message": Commits staged changes with a descriptive message.
git status: Displays the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
git log: Shows a history of commits.
git branch: Lists all branches, highlighting the current branch.
git merge <branch>: Integrates changes from a specified branch into the current branch.
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.

Concepts on GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket
GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform hosting Git repositories, offering features like issue tracking, pull requests, and actions for continuous integration.

GitLab:
GitLab, another web-based Git repository manager, provides integrated CI/CD, a container registry, and collaboration tools. It is available as both a cloud-based service and a self-hosted solution.

BitBucket:
BitBucket, by Atlassian, is a Git repository management solution supporting Git and Mercurial. It includes features such as pull requests, pipelines, and integrations with other Atlassian tools.

Industrial Practices of Using Git
Branching Strategy: Implement a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to organize and manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes.

Commit Messages: Craft clear and descriptive commit messages to effectively communicate the purpose of changes.

Pull Request Reviews: Conduct code reviews through pull requests to ensure code quality and foster knowledge sharing among team members.

Cloning a Repo to Local
git clone <repository_url>
